# Pizza_Sales_sql_bi
This project is about the pizza sales analysis using SQL and PowerBI.

# Objectives:
__Track overall pizza sales performance:__ This includes metrics like total revenue, total orders, average order value, and total pizzas sold. By tracking these metrics over time, the business can identify trends and patterns in sales.

__Analyze pizza category performance:__ The dashboard/queries breaks down sales by pizza category, showing which categories are the most popular and profitable. This information can be used to inform menu decisions, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.

__Understand customer preferences:__ The dashboard also includes data on the percentage of sales by pizza size and the top and bottom selling pizzas. This information can be used to identify customer preferences and develop targeted promotions.
